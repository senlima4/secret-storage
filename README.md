Recently I typing my password with muscle memory not with my brain memory. So just made this for myself.

No network connection need.

Base on electron-react-boilerplate with typescript.

Tried swc and other new tools before. But just tired to find where is fucked in my configuration. So just use with erb to do that.

Electron not that funny. Even pass 3 yrs+. The API docs and ecosystem not that active...

At least react and ipc part is still easy to me.

The thing that takes me the most time is sqlite npm package did not has arm-64(support m1 chip) bundle release, and the second is SWC configuration(give up in the end).
